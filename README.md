# Advanced Class Methods Conclusion

In the past several lessons, we pushed our Ruby skills even farther to
incorporate advanced class methods. We covered building custom class
constructors, class finders and class operators. We implemented a class method
to create instances of its own class. We also used class variables to keep track
of a class's data.

These are all some powerful tools you can use for more complex Ruby operations.
As we move forward, we'll see opportunities to leverage their power in our
larger applications.
